# --- Performance tuning ---
#
# PG_ITERSIZE: rows fetched per PostgreSQL round-trip.
#   Fewer round-trips = less query-planner overhead on the shared Sierra server.
#   Default: 15000.  Safe range: 5000–50000.
PG_ITERSIZE=15000
#
# PG_SLEEP_BETWEEN_TABLES: seconds to pause between each table extraction.
#   Use to reduce load on Sierra during business hours.
#   Default: 0 (no pause).  With 21 tables, adds at most 21×value seconds to total runtime.
# PG_SLEEP_BETWEEN_TABLES=0
#
# EXTRACT_LIMIT: cap each table at this many rows for a fast sample build.
#   Use scripts/build-sample-db.sh to build a sample without editing this file.
#   Default: 0 (no limit — full extraction).
# EXTRACT_LIMIT=500
#
# SQLite write performance is tuned internally (page_size=8192, batch_size=5000,
# journal_mode=OFF, synchronous=OFF, 2GB cache) and requires no env-var changes.
