# RF05: object references (not useful for SQLite)
# RF01-RF03: reference qualification — false positives for json_each and
#   overly strict for complex multi-table analytical views ported from the
#   reference notebook.
# AL03: expression without alias — COUNT(*) in CTEs doesn't need naming.
# AL04/AL08: duplicate alias rules — trigger on valid subquery patterns.
# AM04: SELECT * — used in views that intentionally expand all columns.
# AM05: ambiguous JOIN — JOIN and INNER JOIN are equivalent in SQLite.
# AM09: LIMIT without ORDER BY — intentional in some analytical queries.
# ST09: join condition order — style preference, not correctness.
